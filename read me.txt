This is a 2d vector field generator.
To genrate a vector field you have to open the code and enter the desire vector field equation in ai + bj format 
where 'a' and 'b' any equation you want.
equation = ''  <---- enter the your equation here

vector field equation of dipole and qudrapole is already saved to access that you have to enter
"di_pole" for di-pole vector field and "quad_pole" for quadra-pole without quotation marks 
equation =   <----  here

colour variation is off you can activate it 
#colour variation
col_var = False   <---- change it to true
